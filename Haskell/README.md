## Getting Started

### Installing Haskell

The easiest way to install Haskell is with the "Haskell in 5 Steps" guide, found here: [https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_5_steps](https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_5_steps)

### Building and running Haskell programs

This step is the same for all operating systems. Navigate to the directory containing `hello-world.hs`. 
Compile your haskell program with `ghc -o hello hello.hs`, then run it with ./hello-world, or if you're on a Windows machine, run the executable `hello.exe`

**Congratulations! You've run your first Haskell program!**
