## Getting Started

### Installing Go

The easiest way to run Go programs is by installing an official Go binary. Visit the [Go downloads page](https://golang.org/doc/install) and download the installer for your OS.

To verify the install, type `go version` from the command line.

Go programs should be stored in a workspace (say ~/go-code), and this should be in your GOPATH environment variable.

### Building and running Go programs

This step is the same for all operating systems. Navigate to the directory containing `hello-world.go`. Build your Go program with `go install hello-world`, then run it with ./hello-world.

**Congratulations! You've run your first Go program!**
